Notes on the DarwinCore Archive:

It doesn't need to be a zip, it can be a gzip, or even a nonzipped folder.

Components:

1. One Core Data File (required).
Consisting of a standard set of DWC terms. Fielded text.
Currently two types:
a. Occurrence, or PBD. Core ID is dwc:occurenceID. Terms in http://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_occurrence.xml
b. Taxon. Core ID is dwc:taxonID. Terms in http://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_taxon.xml

2. One or more Extension File/s (optional).
List of accepted extensions in http://rs.gbif.org/extension/

3. One Descriptor Metafile (required if extensions are used or if field names are non-dwc terms)
See metaXmlNotes.txt

4. One Resource Metadata Document (required? not clear)
The use of the GBIF Metadata Profile is suggested. See emlNotes.txt
Others are accepted

All files can be compressed into a single file, using zip or tar.gz

Some requirements:

Mandatory terms for occurrence files:
occurrenceID. If not present, can be a concatenation of institutionCode:collectionCode:catalogNumber
institutionCode
collectionCode
catalogNumber
